 * "Close-enough Sketch"
 *
 * Arduino / EZ1 / Pot / LED
 *    closePin (8) -D-> LED
 *    Analog 0     <-A- EZ1
 *    Analog 1     <-A- Pot
 *
 * The EZ1 is wired in "free run" mode - that is, RX is not connected.
 *
 * User can adjust the "close-enough" value with the pot.  The idea is that:
 *     User places object at "close-enough" range from the EZ1.
 *
 *     User adjusts pot until light comes on / goes off - this sets the pot value.
 *
 *     Object comes and goes - the LED light / turn off.
 *
 *     After object has been close-enough long-enough, light turns off.
 *
 *     If object moves within the close-enough range after timer is off, the
 *     light turns on again.
